# Pacmen
This is a pacman generator that creates a single pacman or multiple pacman that bounce within the boundaries of the screen.
## How To Run 
Once the page loads you will see two buttons at the top left 'Add Pacman' and 'Start Game'.
To create a pacman, click the 'Add Pacman' button. You can create as many as you like. 
Once you've created all the pacmen you would like to create, clicking the 'Start Game button will cause all of them to start moving within the boundaries of your screen.
To reset, refresh the page.

### Future Additions
* Adding a reset button
* Making the image change direction when hitting the screen boundaries
* Making each pacman bounce off each other when colliding
